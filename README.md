## ‚è± WTimer (Work Timer)

This is an app built with ReactJS for recording time when you are working, for eg. On a freelance project. I came up with this site as most of the sites are not up to my liking and I have pretty much created this to cater to my needs.

### Future Additions

I am thinking of adding these features in the future - 

- Google sign-in using Firebase (As everything is now stored in LocalStorage - Not sure about this one!)
- Projects
- Pomodoro Timer
- Todo List
- ~~Mobile Version~~

### Developing

Clone the repo, and just run `npm install`, then `npm start`, simple as that.
