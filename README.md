## WTimer (Work Timer)

This is an app build with ReactJS for recording time when you are working, for eg. On a freelance project. I came up with this site as most of the sites are not up to my liking and I have pretty much created this to cater for my needs, but I will share it to the whole world as I love open source.

### Future Additions

I am thinking of adding these features in the future - 

- Google sign-in using Firebase (As everything is now stored in LocalStorage)
- Projects
- Pomodoro Timer
- Mobile Version

### Developing

Clone the repo, and just run `npm install`, then `npm start`, simple as that.
